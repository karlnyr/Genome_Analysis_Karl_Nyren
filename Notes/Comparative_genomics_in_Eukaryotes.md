# Comparative genomics in Eukaryotes
If you remember that some alterations can affect the karyotpe then we might be able to when the changes occured. Some of the karyotypic alterations are NHEJ - which is when there is a DS break and then the DNA is inserted with foreign DNA instead of the two ends getting joined again. NAHR are when closely located genes recombine during meiosis such that parts of a gene is removed. Then there is copy/paste - reverse transcriptase, and cut/paste - transposase. 

Its not always an easy determination of the underlying processes of alterations, sometimes there can be many combinations. 

How do we compare homologies between species. We can do Whole Genome Alignment (WGA), in some cases the mapping is great, enabling the researcher to tell what parts of the two genomes compared that shares homology. 

Some regions are harder than other to compare, mostly because they are more prone to changes, and thus also leading to more difficulties in getting a accurate assembly.

The false fact that larger genome is more complexity is false, mostly due to that the larger genome is often due to more repetitive elements in a genome. Detect genome duplication? Check gene count in core genome, if duplicated you should be suspicious. 

## Ploidy
There are some very weird ploidies. Depending on what we want to do with an organism the ploidy may determine what is and what is not possible to infer. Octoploid organisms are difficult to assemble since they have gene duplications, which made it hard to determine what chromosome a read belong to. 

## Sex-determination. 
To find these genes we can sequence the heterogametic gender, and if we dont know the sex system we can simply map in both ways, if we have the heterogametic ones we will have genes that wont map to the genome. We can also determine this furhter by making one genome assembly of one heterogametic organism and map males and females to this one. 

Don't be surprised if you find that the system underlying is not what you expected. Stay critical to your data. 

## Programmed DNA elimination
We actually have cases when the genome is not the same in somal and germline cells. It can either be parts of the genome that is removed, and in some cases whole chromosomes are removed. An process is shown in ciliates where they have one micro genome in the germline cells that alters the macro genome and resulting in a altered, spliced, genome in the somatic cells.
