# Functional genomics
The definition of function is not necessarily connected to an physical function in the cells procedures. The definition by encode is that DNA is interacting with something else. Including epigenetic interactions placed on the DNA. So all forms of chromatin modifications will result in effect on biochemical function. We perform epigenomics to find out how the modifications affect the all in all function. 

## Epigenomics assay

__DNA methylation__ - C gets methylated in the genome, leads to condensed nucleosome. Thus transcription repressed, and find the genes that we want to express. Promoters are often enriched in CpG dense sites(CpG island). We chop dna intpo piece, and add adapted, then we do bisulfite treatment which switches the unmethylated C to a U, thus gaining a PCR product of T, can be used in disease control.

__Histone modification__ - ChIP-seq helps to find modifications, by using proteins binding to the modifications of interest, creating anitbodies to these proteins, and then analyse the sequences bound by the protein. 

__Chromatin state__ - NDR, cutting the DNA where it is exposed to DNAse, fragmented regions are exposed, others are not. We get out what is accessible in the genome, but to further infer what is actually affected by the accessibility we need further analysis.

__Chromatin loop__ - Hi-C, a method for chromatin confirmation capture. Point being, it looks for large scale interactions of the chromatin. Zip together DNA, get fragments, purify sequences ligated together, done and done. 

__Limitations with all above__ - Antibodies not specified for your organisms protein, affects ChIP-seq. Signal-to-noise ratio affects methods as well. Sequencing depth, specially affects the signal-to-noise ratio and is affected by funds. 

## Other functional genomics assays
In RNA seq we focus on mRNA, but there are tons of RNAs that has some specific studies. What plays in part there is to get these singled out, and to either filter or perform methods to purify the RNAs of interest. 

What does lncRNA do? interact with proteins, DNA or with RNA/protein interactions. Sometimes transcription just happens doe, so these can actually just be noise. So we try to determine if they have a function or not, using ChIP-seq methods on RNA level. 

Tn-seq - in many genomes we get the full mapping where all the genes are, or what the genes context is. In a nutshell, we insert a artificial transposon, with known sequence, and put it into an organism, it will put itself into the genome of the organism. We then sequence the organism before, check the coverage of the genome before and after a stimuli, thus can in real time check the essential genes of a organisms survival. 

## Concluding remarks
The statement that 80 % of the genome is assigned to a function
